# Minimax Algorithm in Tic Tac Toe
The **Minimax algorithm** is implemented in Tic Tac Toe to create **an unbeatable AI**. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

* **Recursive Search:** The algorithm explores all possible moves, calculating the score for each based on the game's current state.
* **Optimal Strategy:** The AI always chooses the move that minimizes the maximum loss, ensuring it plays optimally.
* **Game Scenarios:** The algorithm evaluates win, lose, and draw conditions to determine the best possible outcome.
  
The implementation ensures the AI is strategically flawless, making it a great learning example for game theory and decision-making algorithms.
